# Minesweeper

This is a super basic Minesweeper I made in a few hours.

It has several difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Custom. Each have different board sizes and bomb counts; the user can choose their own board size and bomb count in Custom difficulty.

There are a few improvements I'd like to make in the future, main one being I want to make it so that the user doesn't have a chance of selecting a bomb on their very first choice.
